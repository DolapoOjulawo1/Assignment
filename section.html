        My name is <b>Dolapo Ojulawo,</b>
       <b>Technology</b>  makes the world one small community.Where my hands cannot reach,
        technology helps me connect by sending <i>hugs</i> to my loved ones.
        I love technology because it keeps me connected which is extremely 
        important when one is 25 and living alone and particularly during a 
        pandemic when work has been put on hold.
        I know that others share my need at all times and especially during a 
        pandemic. As someone who no longer has to go to <i>work</i> or <i>school</i>,I love
        the social benefits of technology- <b><i>Emails, Zoom, GoogleMeet, Slack, and Citrone.</i></b> 
        The people who still must work or attend school or both need to be able to go online to do their work.
         <br>
        Technology helps you organize your life and work better,allows you to access information the moment
         you need it, helps you buy and sell<i>goods and services</i> easier,enables you to find the best 
         price for the items you need.

        <p style="color: red;">
            I've learnt <i>what software development is, how Git and GitHub works, building contact page using
             html,building a card with basic html, building a voting table with html,building a skill set list
              with pure html,board with stickies notes with html and css,css properties, how to beautify a 
              webpage using css, the type/methods of css and the css box-model property.</i>
              <br>

            <b> Importance of CSS</b>
            <br>
            <b>CSS</b> stands for <i>Cascading Style Sheets.</i> It is the coding languague that gives a website
             its look and layout.<b>CSS</b> is fundamental to web design. Without it websites would still be 
             plain text on white backgrounds.
            <br>
            <b>CSS</b> makes the front-end of a website shine and it creates a great user experience. Without 
            <b>CSS</b>, websites would be less pleasing to the eye and likely much harder to navigate. 
            In addition to layout and format, <b>CSS</b> is responsible for font color and more.
           <br>
            With <b>CSS</b>, you can control <i>the color, font, the size of the text, the spacing between the
             elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, what background colors are to be used, 
             different displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more!</i>

    <b>DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PADDINGS, MARGINS AND BORDERS</b>
    <br>
    <b>PADDING</b>
    <br>
    Padding refers to the space between the element content and the element border.
    It is used to create space around an element's content inside of any defined borders,
    It is also the inner space between the content and the border of your box.
    Padding can be set to <i>zero</i> pixels and above,it can change its own element's size and
    impact how much of a fill color or background image is visible within a box.
    It controls how much breathing room exists <i>within</i> a box
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>MARGINS</b>
    <br>
    The margin propery is used to define the space around elements. It clears an area around
    the element. It is used to create space around elements outside of any defined borders,
    It is also the outer space (or lack of space) surrounding the box.
    Margin are essentially invisible barriers around a box. They define how an element interact
    with adjacent elements or the edge of a screen. Margins can be set to <i>zero</i> and above like 
    padding. But unlike padding, margins can also be set to auto and can even have negative values.
    It also controls how much breathing room or <i>whitespace</i> exists <i>outside</i> of a box.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>BORDERS</b>
    <br>
    Border is used to set the border of an element. The <b>CSS</b> border properties <i>(border-style, 
        border-color, border-width and border-radius)</i> are used to specify the style, color and size 
        of an element's border.It is the <b>perimeter</b> of the box, it can be <i>invisible</i> or they
     could be a thick coloured line.
     Border is the strip that goes around your <i>div/element</i> of the content.
